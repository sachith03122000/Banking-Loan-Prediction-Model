# Banking-Loan-Prediction-Model
Conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Kaggle dataset to unveil its underlying trends and insights.
Employed Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Naive Bayes machine learning algorithms to
evaluate the dataset's predictive potential.
Conducted detailed performance analysis, emphasizing metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to pinpoint the best
predictive model. Utilized PowerBI for interactive data visualization. KNN with scaled data emerged as the leader,
achieving 96% accuracy and minimal errors. ROC curve confirmed KNN's superiority with an AUC of 0.82,
outperforming Logistic Regression and Naive-Bayes .
KNN stood out as the best algorithm for predicting loan acceptance, backed by thorough evaluation metrics. Conducted a
comprehensive analysis, pinpointing the most effective predictive model, and crafted a visually engaging dashboard for
enhanced data interpretation and decision-making.
